# How Many Trucks

## What is it?

How Many Trucks is a project to help shippers plan out their freight operations. By answering a few simple questions, and uploading a list of cargo dimensions, our program can optimize the number of trucks needed to ship the freight. It will even show the optimized way to load the freight.

## How does it do this?

Our program is using advanced optimization techniques developed by researchers to help solve the 3-dimensional bin packing problem. This problem is not a solved one, so there is no proof that there is an "objectively correct" answer, but this program does give you a good answer and does it quickly.
